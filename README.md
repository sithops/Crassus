# Crassus

The flexible multi channel extendable subscriber router for you and me.

## Summary

This repository will eventually be home to the Crassus application code. For now
it is only for documentation of the protocol and spec. 

Crassus is still early in its design phase and POCs and experimental projects 
can be found elsewhere in this [project namespace](https://github.com/sithops).

If you would to join along with another language (say for instance rust), 
please contact any member of the team to come in and join the fun! The same 
applies if you would like to join either of the [Golang](https://github.com/sithops/crassus-go-poc)
or [C#](https://github.com/sithops/crassus-csharp-mvp) versions of the project.

Or perhaps you are a technical writer ... then PLEASE, OH PLEASE say hello.

## Protocol Spec

The [protocol spec](SPEC.md) is a work in progress. Spec updates will be tagged
on the master branch with the corresponding version.
